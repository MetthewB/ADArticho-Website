					<h1>The New Yorker is Hiring!</h1>
					<p>The New Yorker, a prestigious magazine known for its witty and thought-provoking content, is on the hunt for a new editorialist. The HR director looks at you and says, "We’re looking for someone who truly understands humor, someone who can make our readers laugh, think, and come back for more." But here’s the catch: Humor is subjective. What makes one person laugh might leave another scratching their head. To prove you’re the right candidate, you’ll need to demonstrate your comedic instincts and align with the humor profile of our readers.</p>
					<p>Fortunately, the amazing ADArticho team thoroughly analyzed the New Yorker Caption Contest dataset and the Oxford Humor in Context dataset to uncover what makes a joke funny, how humor evolves over time, and which themes resonate most with readers. Now, it's time to leverage these insights and test your comedic prowess.</p>
					<h3>Are you ready to prove you have what it takes to land the job? Let’s find out!</h3>

					<h2>Our Big Research Questions</h2>
					<p>But before diving into the data and quizzes, let's understand the New Yorker and Oxford datasets a bit more. Feel free to explore the details of our datasets on the <a href="datasets.html">Datasets Page</a>! From this, our team started with three major questions about humor:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>1. Thematic Structure:</strong> What aspects of their lives do people denounce or joke about most often? Which themes and types of humor recur most frequently in humorous captions?</li>
						<li><strong>2. Cultural Bubble:</strong> Do the successful captions in the New Yorker dataset exhibit cultural or thematic biases that differ from those in the Oxford dataset?</li>
						<li><strong>3. Temporal Change:</strong> How do the thematic structures of humor evolve over time, and can major sociopolitical or cultural events be linked to shifts in the popularity of certain humor themes?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These questions guided our exploration of humor across different contexts, cultures, and time periods. Now, let’s try answering these big questions through the following analyses.</p>

					<h2>The Laughter Lens</h2>
					<p>The New Yorker Caption Contest dataset (NYCC) and Oxford Humor in Context dataset (OHIC) provide a unique opportunity to explore humor through data. Both datasets compile images and captions rated by humans for their funniness.</p>
					<p>NYCC focuses on cartoons, while OHIC features internet memes. Together, they offer insights into humor across institutional and general contexts.</p>

							<li><strong>Sentence Embeddings:</strong> Using sentence-transformers to generate embeddings and cluster captions by humor type.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>These methods provide complementary insights into the thematic and stylistic dimensions of humor.</p>
