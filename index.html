					<h1>The New Yorker is Hiring!</h1>
					<p>The New Yorker, a prestigious magazine known for its witty and thought-provoking content, is on the hunt for a new editorialist. The HR director looks at you and says, "We’re looking for someone who truly understands humor, someone who can make our readers laugh, think, and come back for more." But here’s the catch: Humor is subjective. What makes one person laugh might leave another scratching their head. To prove you’re the right candidate, you’ll need to demonstrate your comedic instincts and align with the humor profile of our readers.</p>
					<p>Fortunately, the amazing ADArticho team thoroughly analyzed the New Yorker Caption Contest dataset and the Oxford Humor in Context dataset to uncover what makes a joke funny, how humor evolves over time, and which themes resonate most with readers. Now, it's time to leverage these insights and test your comedic prowess.</p>

					<h2>Our Big Research Questions</h2>
					<p>But before diving into the data and quizzes, let's understand the New Yorker and Oxford datasets a bit more. Feel free to explore the details of our datasets on the <a href="datasets.html">Datasets Page</a>! From this, our team started with three major questions about humor:</p>
					<div class="question-cards">
						<div class="card">
							<h3><strong>1. Thematic Structure</strong></h3>
							<p>What aspects of their lives do people denounce or joke about most often? Which themes and types of humor recur most frequently in humorous captions?</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<h3><strong>2. Cultural Bubble</strong></h3>
							<p>Do the successful captions in the New Yorker dataset exhibit cultural or thematic biases that differ from those in the Oxford dataset?</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<h3><strong>3. Temporal Change</strong></h3>
							<p>How do the thematic structures of humor evolve over time, and can major sociopolitical or cultural events be linked to shifts in the popularity of humor themes?</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p style="margin-top: 20px;">These questions guided our exploration of humor across different contexts, cultures, and time periods. Now, let’s try answering these big questions through the following analyses.</p>

					<h2>The Laughter Lens</h2>
					<p>The New Yorker Caption Contest dataset (NYCC) and Oxford Humor in Context dataset (OHIC) provide a unique opportunity to explore humor through data. Both datasets compile images and captions rated by humans for their funniness, offering insights into humor across institutional and general contexts.</p>
					
					<div class="dataset-cards">
						<div class="card nycc-card">
							<h3><strong>New Yorker Caption Contest (NYCC):</strong></h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>contests.json:</strong> Metadata such as the number of votes, number of captions, and image descriptions.</li>
								<li><strong>data/:</strong> CSV files for each image, listing captions and their statistics (e.g., number of votes, funny score, mean score).</li>
								<li><strong>images/:</strong> The actual cartoon images in JPG format.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>This dataset focuses on cartoons and contains detailed metadata for each image/contest. Learn more on the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/contest" target="_blank">New Yorker Caption Contest Website</a>.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="card ohic-card">
							<h3><strong>Oxford Humor in Context (OHIC):</strong></h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>oxford_hic_data.csv:</strong> A large CSV file containing all captions for all images along with their funny scores.</li>
								<li><strong>oxford_hic_image_info.csv:</strong> A CSV file containing links to all images.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>This dataset focuses on internet memes and is less detailed than NYCC but still contains the most important information for our project. Learn more in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11636" target="_blank">OHIC Research Paper</a>.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p style="margin-top: 20px;">While OHIC has fewer metadata fields, it complements NYCC by providing a broader perspective on humor in internet culture. Together, these datasets allow us to analyze humor across different formats and contexts.</p>
					<p>We implemented helper functions to load captions in a nearly uniform format between the two datasets, ensuring consistency and removing lines with missing values. Now, let’s dive into the data and uncover what makes humor tick!</h3>

			<!-- 2. Exploratory Data Analysis -->
			<section class="wrapper style1" id="data-story-2">
				<div class="inner">
					<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
					<p>Our analysis revealed key insights into the datasets, focusing on the distribution of captions, voting patterns, and the relationship between caption rank and funniness scores. Below, we highlight three key visualizations, while also summarizing other analyses conducted during this study.</p>
					
					<!-- Distribution of Captions per Image -->
					<h3><strong>1. Distribution of Captions per Image:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/eda-distribution-captions.png" alt="Distribution of Captions per Image" />
					</div>
					<p>In the NYCC dataset, 80% of images have between 4,000 and 8,000 captions, with outliers ranging from 1,066 to 15,329 captions. In contrast, the OHIC dataset shows a power-law distribution, where a few images have many captions (up to 70,000), but 80% of images have only around 20 captions.</p>

					<!-- Normalized Distribution of Votes by Humor Category -->
					<h3><strong>2. Normalized Distribution of Votes by Humor Category:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/eda-votes-distribution.png" alt="Normalized Distribution of Votes by Humor Category" />
					</div>
					<p>The distribution of votes across humor categories reveals that "Not Funny" dominates, especially in the mid-range (50–150 votes). "Somewhat Funny" peaks at lower vote counts (10–40), while "Funny" is heavily concentrated near 0–10 votes. This reflects the subjective nature of humor and the difficulty of creating universally appealing captions.</p>

					<!-- Caption Rank vs. Mean Funniness Score -->
					<h3><strong>3. Caption Rank vs. Mean Funniness Score:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/eda-rank-vs-funniness.png" alt="Caption Rank vs. Mean Funniness Score" />
					</div>
					<p>Captions with the best ranks (1–10) have distinctly higher mean funniness scores, averaging around 1.9. Beyond rank 10, the scores drop sharply and stabilize near the minimum. Captions that stand out tend to receive higher funniness scores, but the majority remain at the lower end of the scale, most low-ranked captions are uniformly mediocre.</p></p>

					<!-- Summary of Other Analyses -->
					<h3><strong>Additional Analyses Conducted:</strong></h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Correlation Heatmap (NYCC Features):</strong> Explored the relationships between numeric features, revealing strong correlations between vote categories (e.g., "Funny," "Somewhat Funny," "Not Funny").</li>
						<li><strong>Evolution of Captions and Votes Over Time:</strong> Analyzed how the total number of captions and votes evolved throughout the contest, showing significant variability in engagement across images.</li>
						<li><strong>Caption Rank vs. Votes:</strong> Investigated the relationship between caption rank and the number of votes received, highlighting that higher-ranked captions tend to receive more votes.</li>
						<li><strong>Boxplot of Mean Scores for Top-Ranked Captions:</strong> Visualized the variability in mean scores for top-ranked captions, showing that winning captions can vary significantly in their funniness scores.</li>
						<li><strong>Monotonic Relationship Between Rank and Funniness:</strong> Found that top-ranked captions have distinctly higher funniness scores, while lower-ranked captions stabilize near the minimum. The difference between mid- and low-ranked captions becomes less perceptible.</li>
					</ul>

					<!-- NYCC vs OHIC Insights -->
					<p style="margin-top: 30px;"></p>
					<div class="eda-cards">
						<div class="card nycc-card">
							<h3><strong>NYCC Insights:</strong></h3>
							<ul>
								<li>The NYCC dataset has a more uniform distribution of captions per image, with most images receiving a moderate number of captions. This suggests a relatively balanced engagement across contests.</li>
								<li>Higher-ranked captions tend to receive more votes across all categories ("Funny," "Somewhat Funny," and "Not Funny"), indicating that visibility plays a significant role in voting dynamics.</li>
								<li>The audience for NYCC appears to be highly critical, with the majority of votes falling into the "Not Funny" category, reflecting the subjective nature of humor.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<p style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>
						<div class="card ohic-card">
							<h3><strong>OHIC Insights:</strong></h3>
							<ul>
								<li>The OHIC dataset is highly unbalanced, with a few images receiving a disproportionately large number of captions, while most images receive very few. This highlights the uneven engagement in this dataset.</li>
								<li>Humor perception in OHIC follows a power-law distribution, where a small subset of captions dominates the "Funny" category, while the majority are rated as "Not Funny."</li>
								<li>The dataset's focus on internet memes may contribute to its variability, as memes often rely on niche cultural references that may not resonate universally.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p style="margin-top: 20px;">Then, we observe that humor is highly subjective, with most captions receiving low funniness scores. Captions with higher visibility tend to attract more votes across all categories, highlighting the role of exposure in voting dynamics. The NYCC dataset shows more balanced engagement due to its structured contests, while OHIC's meme-based content results in greater variability and imbalanced participation. These findings underscore the challenges of analyzing humor quantitatively and the importance of considering context and audience dynamics.</p>

			<!-- 3. Caption Length and Funniness -->
			<section class="wrapper style1" id="data-story-3">
				<div class="inner align-left">
					<h2>Caption Length and Funniness</h2>
					<p>Our analysis shows that shorter captions tend to be funnier. The most frequent caption length is around 8 words, representing concise, one-sentence jokes. Longer captions, while occasionally effective, often lose their punch and are less likely to be rated as funny.</p>
					
					<!-- Distribution of Caption Lengths -->
					<h3><strong>1. Distribution of Caption Lengths:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/caption-length-distribution.png" alt="Distribution of Caption Lengths (in Words)" />
					</div>
					<p>The distribution of caption lengths is <strong>right-skewed</strong>, with most captions being short. The most frequent length is around 8 words, while very few captions exceed 20 words. This suggests that brevity is a hallmark of humor, as punchy, economical language tends to dominate.</p>

					<!-- Caption Length vs. Mean Funniness Votes -->
					<h3><strong>2. Caption Length vs. Mean Funniness Votes:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/caption-length-vs-funniness.png" alt="Caption Length vs. Mean Funniness Votes" />
					</div>
					<p>Our scatterplot analysis, which focuses on captions below 50 words, revealed a <strong>weak negative trend</strong>: as captions get longer, their average funniness tends to decrease slightly. Shorter captions (under 20 words) are generally rated as funnier, as concise, punchy humor tends to perform better. This trend suggests that brevity might play a role in crafting more effective jokes, though the relationship is not very strong.</p>

			<!-- 4. Winning Captions -->
			<section class="wrapper style1" id="data-story-4">
				<div class="inner align-left">
					<h2>What Makes a Winning Caption?</h2>
					<p>Winning captions attract significantly more votes than average captions. This is a striking contrast to the average caption, which receives far fewer votes. Despite their success, winning captions can still polarize readers. They often receive a mix of positive and negative votes, showing that even the most popular captions do not appeal to everyone.</p>
					
					<!-- Total Votes vs. Winning Votes -->
					<h3><strong>1. Total Votes vs. Winning Votes:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/winning-votes-log.png" alt="Total Votes vs. Winning Votes (Log Scale)" />
					</div>
					<p>Winning captions dominate the voting landscape, gathering around 100 times more votes than the average caption. This dominance is evident in the log-scale plot, where winning captions consistently attract a significant share of total votes. On average, they concentrate around 1% of all votes, highlighting their ability to capture the audience's attention and engagement.</p>

					<!-- Correlation Between Vote Categories -->
					<h3><strong>2. Correlation Between Vote Categories:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/winning-votes-correlation.png" alt="Correlation Between Vote Categories" />
					</div>
					<p>Our analysis revealed a clear correlation between the number of votes in each category ("Funny," "Somewhat Funny," "Not Funny") for winning captions. This indicates that winning captions tend to attract attention across all voting categories, further emphasizing their polarizing nature. Even the most popular captions evoke mixed reactions, reflecting the subjective nature of humor.</p>
					<p>Interestingly, even winning captions, while receiving the highest scores, still show variability in their funniness ratings. This highlights the subjective nature of humor perception, where even the most popular captions do not appeal to everyone.</p>

			<!-- 5. Humor Type Classification -->
			<section class="wrapper style1" id="data-story-5">
				<div class="inner align-left">
					<h2>Identifying Humor Types</h2>
					<p>We classified captions into predefined humor categories (e.g., <strong style="color:red;">Satirical</strong>, <strong style="color:deeppink;">Sarcastic</strong>, <strong style="color:dodgerblue;">Absurd</strong>, <strong style="color:steelblue;">Dark</strong>, <strong style="color:palevioletred;">Raunchy</strong>, <strong style="color:darkgreen;">Offensive</strong>, <strong style="color:darkorange;">Motivational</strong>, <strong style="color:lightseagreen;">Clever</strong>, <strong style="color:mediumorchid;">Corny</strong>, <strong style="color:blue;">Friendly</strong>, <strong style="color:teal;">Goofy</strong>) to explore the different styles of humor present in the datasets. These categories capture the thematic and stylistic dimensions of humor, ranging from witty wordplay to socially awkward situations.</p>
					<p>We used two complementary approaches for humor type classification: zero-shot classification and sentence embeddings. For a detailed explanation of the classification process and the models used, please refer to the <a href="models-methods.html#NLP" target="_blank">Models & Methods: Humor Type Classification</a> section.</p>

					<!-- Humor Type Distributions -->
					<h3><strong>1. Humor Type Distributions:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/humor-type-distributions.png" alt="Humor Type Distributions (NYCC vs. OHIC)" />
					</div>
					<p>The distribution of humor types in NYCC and OHIC reveals both similarities and differences. In both datasets, <strong style="color:red;">Satirical</strong>, <strong style="color:darkgreen;">Offensive</strong>, and <strong style="color:mediumorchid;">Corny</strong> humor types dominate, reflecting their broad appeal and frequent use. However, the least common humor types differ between the two datasets:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>NYCC:</strong> <strong style="color:steelblue;">Dark</strong>, <strong style="color:palevioletred;">Raunchy</strong>, and <strong style="color:lightseagreen;">Clever</strong> humor types are the least prevalent, suggesting that the New Yorker audience prefers humor with a more sophisticated or institutional tone.</li>
						<li><strong>OHIC:</strong> <strong style="color:deeppink;">Sarcastic</strong>, <strong style="color:lightseagreen;">Clever</strong>, and <strong style="color:blue;">Friendly</strong> humor types are the least prevalent, indicating that internet-based humor leans more toward absurdity and edgier themes.</li>
					</ul>

					<!-- Humor Type vs. Rank -->
					<h3><strong>2. Humor Type vs. Rank:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/humor-type-vs-rank.png" alt="Humor Type vs. Rank" />
					</div>
					<p>Our analysis of humor type vs. rank revealed that <strong style="color:lightseagreen;">Clever</strong> and <strong style="color:blue;">Friendly</strong> humor types tend to achieve better ranks, reflecting their broad appeal. In contrast, humor types like <strong style="color:steelblue;">Dark</strong> and <strong style="color:palevioletred;">Raunchy</strong>, while polarizing, often rank lower due to their niche appeal. This suggests that humor types with broader, more inclusive themes are more likely to succeed in contests.</p>
					<p style="margin-top: 40px">Using these approaches, we observed similar humor distributions in NYCC and OHIC, reflecting shared humor trends across institutional and internet contexts. However, some humor types, like <strong style="color:red;">Satirical</strong> and <strong style="color:mediumorchid;">Corny</strong>, were more prevalent in NYCC, while others, like <strong style="color:steelblue;">Dark</strong> and <strong style="color:palevioletred;">Raunchy</strong>, were more common in OHIC. Our analysis revealed that <strong style="color:lightseagreen;">Clever</strong> humor, characterized by wit and wordplay, and <strong style="color:blue;">Friendly</strong> humor, which is light-hearted and inclusive, consistently scored higher in funniness. On the other hand, humor types like <strong style="color:steelblue;">Dark</strong> and <strong style="color:palevioletred;">Raunchy</strong> were more polarizing, with mixed reactions from readers.</p>

			<!-- 6. Topic Classification -->
			<section class="wrapper style1" id="data-story-6">
				<div class="inner align-left">
					<h2>Identifying Topics in Captions</h2>
					<p>We classified captions into predefined topics (e.g., <strong style="color:red;">Love</strong>, <strong style="color:deeppink;">Family</strong>, <strong style="color:dodgerblue;">School</strong>, <strong style="color:steelblue;">Work</strong>, <strong style="color:palevioletred;">Politics and Social Issues</strong>, <strong style="color:darkgreen;">Nature</strong>, <strong style="color:darkorange;">Food</strong>, <strong style="color:lightseagreen;">Emotions</strong>, <strong style="color:mediumorchid;">Entertainment and Pop Culture</strong>, <strong style="color:blue;">Caption Contest</strong>, <strong style="color:teal;">Health</strong>, <strong style="color:blueviolet;">Law</strong>, <strong style="color:dimgrey;">Other</strong>) to explore the thematic dimensions of humor in the datasets.</p>
					<p>We used a sentence embedding approach to classify captions into topics. For a detailed explanation of the classification process, see the <a href="models-methods.html#NLP" target="_blank">Models & Methods: Topic Classification</a> section.</p>
					
					<!-- Topic Distributions -->
					<h3><strong>1. Topic Distributions:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/topic-distributions.png" alt="Topic Distributions (NYCC vs. OHIC)" />
					</div>
					<p style="margin-top: 20px;">We also created an interactive pie chart to visualize the topic distributions in both datasets. You can explore it below:</p>
					<p style="margin-top: -30px;"></p>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<iframe src="topic_distribution_piechart.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
					</div>
					<p style="margin-top: -30px;"></p>
					<p>The distribution of topics in NYCC and OHIC revealed both shared and unique trends. Topics like <strong style="color:red;">Love</strong>, <strong style="color:deeppink;">Family</strong>, and <strong style="color:steelblue;">Work</strong> were the most frequently occurring, reflecting shared social roles, domestic life, and workplace dynamics. In contrast, topics like <strong style="color:palevioletred;">Politics and Social Issues</strong> were more prominent in OHIC, aligning with its internet-based context and focus on societal critique. Other topics, such as <strong style="color:darkgreen;">Nature</strong>, <strong style="color:darkorange;">Food</strong>, and <strong style="color:mediumorchid;">Entertainment and Pop Culture</strong>, highlighted environmental concerns, cultural rituals, and media consumption, while institutional topics like <strong style="color:teal;">Health</strong> and <strong style="color:blueviolet;">Law</strong> critiqued societal structures and professional roles.</p>

					<!-- Topic vs. Funniness Scores -->
					<h3><strong>2. Humor Type vs. Funniness Scores:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/topic-vs-funniness.png" alt="Topic vs. Funniness Scores" />
					</div>
					<p>Our analysis revealed that topics like <strong style="color:red;">Love</strong> and <strong style="color:deeppink;">Family</strong> consistently scored higher in funniness, reflecting their broad appeal and relatability. These topics often draw on shared experiences and interpersonal dynamics, making them universally engaging. In contrast, topics like <strong style="color:palevioletred;">Politics and Social Issues</strong> were more polarizing, with mixed reactions from readers. This polarization may stem from the abstract and institutional language used in these captions, which focus on collective or systemic concepts rather than individual experiences.</p>

					<!-- Topic vs. Rank -->
					<h3><strong>3. Humor Type vs. Rank:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/topic-vs-rank.png" alt="Topic vs. Rank" />
					</div>
					<p>When analyzing topic vs. rank, relational topics like <strong style="color:red;">Love</strong> and <strong style="color:deeppink;">Family</strong> tended to achieve better ranks, reflecting their broad appeal and universal relatability. In contrast, topics like <strong style="color:palevioletred;">Politics and Social Issues</strong> and <strong style="color:darkgreen;">Nature</strong> often ranked lower, possibly due to their niche appeal or reliance on commentary and critique. Topics like <strong style="color:steelblue;">Work</strong> and <strong style="color:darkorange;">Food</strong> achieved moderate ranks, blending humor with shared cultural experiences and professional dynamics.</p>
					<p style="margin-top: 40px">Overall, the topic classification highlights the diverse thematic dimensions of humor in the datasets. Relational topics like <strong style="color:red;">Love</strong> and <strong style="color:deeppink;">Family</strong> resonate broadly with audiences, while institutional topics like <strong style="color:teal;">Health</strong> and <strong style="color:blueviolet;">Law</strong> provide humor rooted in societal critique. The prominence of topics like <strong style="color:darkgreen;">Nature</strong> and <strong style="color:palevioletred;">Politics and Social Issues</strong> in OHIC reflects its internet-based context, where commentary and critique are more prevalent. These findings underscore the role of context and audience in shaping the thematic content of humor.</p>

			<!-- 8. Stylistic Analysis -->
			<section class="wrapper style1" id="data-story-8">
				<div class="inner align-left">
					<h2>Stylistic Analysis</h2>
					<p>Our stylistic analysis focused on three key aspects of the captions: word length distributions, formality scores, and part-of-speech distributions. These metrics provide insights into the linguistic characteristics of captions in the NYCC and OHIC datasets, highlighting differences in tone, structure, and word usage.</p>

					<!-- Word Length Distributions -->
					<h3><strong>1. Word Length Distributions:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<img src="images/word_length_distribution.png" alt="Word Length Distribution: NYCC vs OHIC" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
					</div>
					<p>The word length distributions reveal that NYCC captions are more concentrated in length, particularly for the most highly ranked captions, while OHIC captions show a broader distribution. Interestingly, longer captions are more represented among the funniest captions in the OHIC dataset, suggesting a preference for more elaborate humor.</p>
					
					<!-- Part-of-Speech Distributions -->
					<h3><strong>2. Part-of-Speech Distributions:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<canvas id="posDistributionChart"></canvas>
					</div>
					<p>The part-of-speech distributions highlight differences in word usage between the two datasets. NYCC captions feature a higher density of nouns, adjectives, and verbs, reflecting a more descriptive and action-oriented style. OHIC captions, on the other hand, show a higher density of interjections and unknown words, indicative of a more casual and expressive tone. The higher proportion of interjections in OHIC aligns with its internet-based context, where captions often rely on exaggerated expressions and slang.</p>
					
					<!-- Formality Score Distributions -->
					<h3><strong>3. Formality Score Distributions:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<iframe src="formality.html" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
					</div>
					<p style="margin-top: -180px;">The formality score distributions reveal distinct patterns between the two datasets. Captions in the NYCC dataset tend to have higher formality scores, with a peak in the mid-range, reflecting a balance between conversational and formal tones. In contrast, captions in the OHIC dataset exhibit a broader distribution, with a higher density of lower formality scores, indicating a more casual and internet-driven tone. This difference aligns with the institutional context of NYCC and the internet-based, meme-driven nature of OHIC.</p>
					<p>Notably, the mean formality for NYCC captions is slightly higher than that of a US president speech, while the mean formality for OHIC captions is comparable to one, right above that of a script from "The Simpsons". Additionally, the formality scores for OHIC captions show higher variability compared to NYCC, reflecting a broader range of tones in the OHIC dataset. However, both datasets exhibit much lower formality than a typical New Yorker article.</p>					

					<p>These stylistic differences underscore the influence of context and audience on the linguistic characteristics of captions. While NYCC captions balance formality and descriptive language to appeal to a broader audience, OHIC captions embrace a more casual and expressive style, resonating with internet culture.</p>

				<div class="inner align-left">
					<h2>How Humor Evolves Over Time</h2>
					<p>The evolution of humor topics in the New Yorker captions reveals significant trends over time, reflecting societal events and cultural shifts. By analyzing the proportions of topics across years, we can observe how external factors influence the thematic focus of captions.</p>
					
					<!-- Topic Proportions Over Time -->
					<h3><strong>1. Topic Proportions Over Time:</strong></h3>
					<p>The interactive plot below illustrates the proportions of various topics in captions over time. You can explore the trends by hovering over the lines to see specific values for each year and topic.</p>
					<p style="margin-top: -20px;"></p>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<iframe src="http://127.0.0.1:8060" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
					</div>
					<p>The topic proportions over time highlight the dominance of certain themes, such as <strong style="color:darkorange;">Food</strong> and <strong style="color:blue;">Caption Contest</strong>, which consistently maintain high proportions across the years. These topics reflect universal and timeless themes that resonate broadly with audiences. Additionally, the overall stability of the curves suggests that the thematic focus of captions remains relatively consistent over time, with each topic maintaining a steady presence in the dataset.</p>
					
					<!-- Topic Variation Heatmap -->
					<h3><strong>2. Topic Variation Heatmap:</strong></h3>
					<div class="plot-container">
						<iframe src="topic_variation_heatmap.html" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
					</div>
					<p style="margin-top: -20px;">The heatmap of topic variation (z-scores) provides a deeper look at deviations from the mean topic proportions. Notable spikes in specific years highlight the influence of external events on humor. For instance, in <strong>2016</strong>, captions related to <strong style="color:blueviolet;">Law</strong> and <strong style="color:palevioletred;">Politics and Social Issues</strong> peaked, coinciding with the U.S. presidential election and the rise of Trump. Similarly, in <strong>2022</strong> and <strong>2024</strong>, there is a noticeable rise in captions about <strong style="color:mediumorchid;">Entertainment and Pop Culture</strong>, possibly reflecting the growing influence of media consumption, celebrity culture, and the resurgence of major global events like the Oscars or the World Cup.</p>
					
					<p>These analyses demonstrate how external events and societal changes shape the thematic focus of humor over time. By examining these trends, we gain insights into the dynamic interplay between cultural context and humor.</p>
