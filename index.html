					<h1>The New Yorker is Hiring!</h1>
					<p>The New Yorker, a prestigious magazine known for its witty and thought-provoking content, is on the hunt for a new editorialist. The HR director looks at you and says, "We’re looking for someone who truly understands humor, someone who can make our readers laugh, think, and come back for more." But here’s the catch: Humor is subjective. What makes one person laugh might leave another scratching their head. To prove you’re the right candidate, you’ll need to demonstrate your comedic instincts and align with the humor profile of our readers.</p>
					<p>Fortunately, the amazing ADArticho team thoroughly analyzed the New Yorker Caption Contest dataset and the Oxford Humor in Context dataset to uncover what makes a joke funny, how humor evolves over time, and which themes resonate most with readers. Now, it's time to leverage these insights and test your comedic prowess.</p>
					<h3>Are you ready to prove you have what it takes to land the job? Let’s find out!</h3>

					<h2>Our Big Research Questions</h2>
					<p>But before diving into the data and quizzes, let's understand the New Yorker and Oxford datasets a bit more. Feel free to explore the details of our datasets on the <a href="datasets.html">Datasets Page</a>! From this, our team started with three major questions about humor:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>1. Thematic Structure:</strong> What aspects of their lives do people denounce or joke about most often? Which themes and types of humor recur most frequently in humorous captions?</li>
						<li><strong>2. Cultural Bubble:</strong> Do the successful captions in the New Yorker dataset exhibit cultural or thematic biases that differ from those in the Oxford dataset?</li>
						<li><strong>3. Temporal Change:</strong> How do the thematic structures of humor evolve over time, and can major sociopolitical or cultural events be linked to shifts in the popularity of certain humor themes?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These questions guided our exploration of humor across different contexts, cultures, and time periods. Now, let’s try answering these big questions through the following analyses.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<!-- Cultural Humor Section -->
			<section class="wrapper style1" id="data-story-1">
				<!-- Data Story Content -->
				<div class="inner align-left">
					<h2>How Does Humor Vary Across Cultures?</h2>
					<p>Humor is deeply influenced by cultural norms and traditions. What’s funny in one culture might not resonate in another. For example, wordplay and puns are highly appreciated in some cultures, while slapstick humor dominates in others.</p>
					<p>Our analysis shows that cultural references in jokes often determine their appeal to specific audiences.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="inner align-left">
					<h2>The Art of Wordplay</h2>
					<p>Wordplay, such as puns and clever turns of phrase, is a timeless form of humor. Our analysis shows that readers appreciate jokes that play with language, especially when the punchline is unexpected.</p>
					<p>However, not everyone enjoys puns—some find them groan-worthy!</p>

                    <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Our analysis revealed key insights into humor distribution and voting patterns:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most captions in both datasets are rated as "Not Funny," with only a small subset receiving high funniness scores.</li>
                        <li>The New Yorker dataset shows a more balanced distribution of captions per image compared to the Oxford dataset.</li>
                        <li>Humor perception follows a power-law distribution: a few captions dominate the upper tail, while most receive minimal engagement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These findings highlight the subjective nature of humor and the challenges of analyzing it quantitatively.</p>
